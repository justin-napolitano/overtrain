# Overtrain

A reflective personal project exploring the consequences of excessive exercise and the challenges of balancing physical training with recovery. This repository captures insights on overtraining through journaling and self-observation.

## Features

- Personal narrative and reflections on exercise habits
- Focus on the physical and mental impact of overtraining
- Simple markdown-based documentation

## Tech Stack

- Markdown for content
- Static site or markdown viewer assumed (no explicit codebase present)

## Getting Started

Since this repository primarily contains markdown content, no installation or runtime environment is necessary beyond a markdown viewer or static site generator.

To view the content locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/justin-napolitano/overtrain.git

# Open `index.md` in your preferred markdown viewer or editor
```

## Project Structure

```
/overtrain
  └── index.md      # Main reflective journal entry on overtraining
```

## Future Work / Roadmap

- Expand content with additional reflections and data on training and recovery
- Potentially add scripts or tools to track exercise and recovery metrics
- Integrate with static site generators for improved presentation
- Include data visualization or analysis of training patterns
