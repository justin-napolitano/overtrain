# Overtrain: A Technical Reflection on Excessive Physical Training

## Motivation

This project serves as a personal technical journal documenting the behavioral and physiological consequences of overtraining. The motivation lies in understanding the fine line between productive exercise and injury-inducing excess, particularly as physical recovery slows with age.

## Problem Statement

Excessive physical training without adequate recovery leads to injury, decreased performance, and impaired cognitive function. This project addresses the need to document and analyze these effects through structured reflection.

## Implementation Details

The project is implemented as a markdown-based journal entry (`index.md`) capturing qualitative data about exercise habits, mental state, and injury symptoms. The content is structured with sections outlining motivations, running habits, injury experiences, and cognitive effects.

The use of markdown allows for simple, version-controlled documentation without additional dependencies or complexity. This approach emphasizes lightweight, accessible record-keeping over automated data collection.

## Technical and Practical Considerations

- **Data Structure**: The project uses plain markdown with front matter metadata (title, date, tags, categories) to organize content semantically.

- **Content Focus**: The narrative prioritizes candid self-assessment over prescriptive advice, avoiding motivational or life-coaching language.

- **Extensibility**: The current format supports incremental additions and potential integration with static site generators or data visualization tools.

- **Limitations**: The lack of automated data capture or analysis limits quantitative insights but preserves a human-centered perspective.

## Summary

Overtrain documents the experiential realities of pushing physical limits beyond sustainable thresholds. It provides a reference point for future technical exploration of training data, recovery strategies, and the cognitive impacts of physical stress. The project’s minimalist implementation reflects a deliberate choice to prioritize reflective clarity over technological complexity.
