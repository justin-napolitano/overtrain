## Why

i like to exercise. i like to over-exercise. i do not listen to my body when it needs rest. i feel as if more movement is more better.

i am getting older. i do not recover quickly.  
   
 
## Running

when i feel stressed i run. it is a low cost way to move.

### Over running

when i run, i feel a need to prove to myself that i am a runner. i begin my jog planning a 5k... i hit my mark an push it further until i cannot stand... then i push it further to make it back home.  

### Injury

today my knee hurts. my thinking is slow. i cannot focus. i pushed it too hard.  i had not too long ago been in the shape to handle a 10k and some calisthenics. i am not currently. my body more or less told me so, but i chose to ignore it to prove to myself that i am strong. 

### Foolishness

i know my line of thinkiing is ridiculous. i know that it would serve me betterto do a moderate amount of exerise daily rather than binge and encourage injury... but i like the feeling of pushing myself to the limit.
